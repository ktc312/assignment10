Q5) According to the plots, we can see that the amount of grade A are expanding for both nyc as a whole or in each boro. Therefore we can say that the grading system motivates resturant improving their quality

Q6) There are many other information we can find out using this data. For example, using the cuisine column with our test_Grades function, we can see which cuisine presents the best quality. Also, for some large resturant chains we can see their quality at different boros.

I think this data is useful for assessing the quality of new york city, for example, if a resturant constantly graded below A, then this kind of restuant can be considered as bad quality resturant because they are likely not working for a higher grade. On the opposite resturants that constantly graded as A can be considered as high quality resturants. Using this logic, we can have a close look at the quality of new york resturant.
